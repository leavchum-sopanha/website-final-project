# About the Project

The project is part of my final project on the Web Design course in my third year at ACLEDA University of Business (2024). 
I cloned the website from this: https://malis.thalias.com.kh/
It might look different from the original website because I did not clone all the web pages there, and the original webpage have updated its interface recently too.
